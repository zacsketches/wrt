#WRT54GL
####July 2015 - I've been playing with a new WRT54GL router for about a month now and wanted to go back and make a list of the configuration lessons learned I've tracked down.  My primary references are this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54G-Ultimate-Hacking-Asadoorian/dp/1597491667/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436045407&sr=1-1&keywords=wrt54g), and the OpenWrt [website](openwrt.org).

##The basics
1. **Logging in** - The first thing I had to do was configure my computer to log into  the Linksys router.  The default IP on the router is 192.168.1.1. so I had to give my computer a manual IP on the same subnet. I chose 192.168.1.54.  In the systems preferences panel I selected to use "DHCP with manual IP".  With that completed just plug into any LAN port on the router and load the router address in a browser to get to the web interface.
2. **Wireless while connected directly** - Next I wanted to be able to browse the web while I'm working on this so I enabled my wifi card to link into the home network.  The problem came up that whenever I was connected to both networks I couldn't get web traffic to route to the wifi.  So again, open up network
preferences and in the bottom left hit the little gear.  In there you can "Set Service Order.."  By dragging the wifi interface higher in the list it pushed traffic toward that interface first.

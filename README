README Notes for WRT folder

In June of 2015 I bought the Linksys WRT54GL router version 1.1.

Along with that I bought the book Liksys WRT54G ultimate hacking
by Paul Asadoorian and Larry Pesce.  This blog is my rambling notes
to myself as I work through the book and figure out how I might
incorporate this into my other projects.

The first thing I had to do was configure my computer to log into 
the Linksys router.  The default IP on the router is 192.168.1.1.
So I had to give my computer a manual IP on the same subnet. I 
chose 192.168.1.54.  In the systems preferences panel I selected to 
use "DHCP with manual IP".  With that completed just plug into any LAN
port on the router and load the router address in a browser
to get to the web interface.

Next I wanted to be able to browse the web while I'm working on this
so I enabled my wifi card to link into the home network.  The problem
came up that whenever I was connected to both networks I couldn't 
get web traffic to route to the wifi.  So again, open up network
preferences and in the bottom left hit the little gear.  In there you
can "Set Service Order.."  By dragging the wifi interfact higher
in the list it pushed traffic toward that interface first.

Files:
I've written a few shell scripts to aid in this process.  All are 
stored in my ~/Documents/mybin folder:
	ip.sh - return the ip address of the host
	check_md5.sh - check the md5 hash of a source against the 
		provided md5 sum to ensure the match
	wrt_console.sh - connect to the console over the ftdi 
		connection allowing serial comms directly with the
		wrt's linux processer.
